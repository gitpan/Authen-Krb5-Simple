Authen::Krb5::Simple version 0.32
===============================================================================

The Authen::Krb5::Simple module provides a means to authenticate a
user/password using Kerberose 5.  Simply use this module and call its
authenticate function with a username (or user@KRB_REALM) and a password.

Detailed usage information can be found in the module's perldoc.

INSTALLATION

To install this module edit the CONFIG file to set test kerberos realm,
username and password.  These are optional.  If either the username or
password is not given, then the user auth tests will be skipped. If a
realm is specified, it will be used for the test.  Otherwise, the default
realm for the system will be used (if properly configured of course).

You can also specify a location of the Kerberos include and libs directories
in the environment variables KRB5_INCLUDE and KRB5_LIB respectively. Setting
these will cause the build to try them first.  This would normally be used
if your Kerberos libraries are in a non-standard location, or you wanted to
overide the system defaults.

Once that is done, then type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Note: In the absence of the KRB5_INCLUDE and KRB4LIB environment variables
      mentioned above, the module will make an attempt to try and find
      out the location of the Kerberos 5 include and lib files.  If that
      doesn't work, you will need to manually override by setting the
      environment variables or editing Makfile.PL to directly.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the Kerberos 5 header and library files installed
on the local system.
